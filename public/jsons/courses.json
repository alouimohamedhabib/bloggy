      "description": "This course will help you learn Symfony the powerful PHP framework that would let you create not only websites but great web applications, APIs or mobile backends.\n\nIts latest version is the most powerful, yet simplest to use for developers. If you want to get started with Symfony, this is the best place you could get.\n\nWe'll go through each single task step by step; you will code along with me. I'd explain every detail of how things work, and how things should be done.\n\nI'll even leave some scene with error uncut that you can see and experience a real-world coding example and how the journey is!\n\nAt the end of this course, you will complete a fully working, real world application. \n\nThe recommended development environment is Linux for the sake of speed and optimization for developer, but if you are on Windows or MacOs no worries. I won't be using any tool or package that could restrict you from taking this course if you are on another environment.\n\nThe course starts with introduction.\n\nThen we'll move on and install the framework using official documentation and guides.\n\nNext section is cantered around Controllers, Routes and Twig templating engine. You will learn how to create a backbone of your application and how to render HTML together with data using Twig. We will also see how we can install and manage assets, like CSS & JavaScript, by installing Bootstrap using npm (You can use Yarn if you are comfortable with).\n\nAfter that, will touch databases and the excellent Doctrine ORM. You will learn how you can create simple PHP objects as a representation of a table rows. You will learn about database migrations - an easy way of managing your database schema changes. This section will also show you how to quickly fetch, modify and delete data from the database.\n\nAnd we end up doing some Front-End work updating and customizing the User Interface.\n\n Who this course is for:\n\nPHP developers that do not know any framework\n\nDevelopers with some knowledge of other PHP frameworks\n\nDevelopers that need and want to pick-up Symfony fast with straight to the point course",
